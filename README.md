# Physics App
    - This is a basic physics calculator with a virtual assistant for UW-Milwaukee Comp Sci 250 at Pius XI

# How To Run
    1. Dont be a loser and use a debugger to run it
        - Mostly because you are a loser if you do BUT...
        - It wont run because it doesnt know the class file is in build/classes
        - But also, you'll run into package not found or package mismatch errors
        - Hand-compiling solves this
        - Real programmers hand compile
    2. Make sure you are in the proper directory by running this in the terminal:
        - cd PhysicsHelper2025/physics-app 
    3. copy and paste or hand type this in the terminal:
        - Linux: javac *.java && mv *.class build/classes && java -cp build/classes main
        - Windows: idk cuz powershell sucks, use the debugger in this case because you already use windows so i think you can infer what that means
        - Mac OS: should be relatively similar to the linux command

# Boom
    - You have a basic physics calculator with a virtual assistant chat bot
    - Enjoy!
